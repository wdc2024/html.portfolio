<h2>My Journey</h2>
My love for photography and videography began at a young age, inspired by street and studio photographers including movies. Over the years, I’ve honed my craft through other photographers i.e Favier Productions, Njeri Photographt, Tony Trivet, Canon workshops and Online Courses and Tutorials. Today, I’m proud to offer a unique blend of technical skill and artistic vision in every project I undertake.
